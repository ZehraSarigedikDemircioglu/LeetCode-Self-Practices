/*
Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in
the range that is missing from the array.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [3, 0, 1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0, 3]. 2 is the missing
number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [0, 1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0, 2]. 2 is the missing
number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
Example 3:
Input: nums = [9, 6, 4, 2, 3, 5, 7, 0, 1]
Output: 8
Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0, 9]. 8 is the missing
number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
